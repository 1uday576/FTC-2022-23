# FTC-2022-23

This is the code used for the RGB 22075 robot in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) during the 2022-23 season. The code is separated into two main parts: driver control and autonomous. Driver control was my responsibility and written entirely by me. The code for driver control focused on allowing the two drivers to control the functions of the robot to score points. These functions include:

  -	Moving the robot
  -	Lifting the arm up and down
  -	Moving the arm mechanism up and down
  -	Opening and closing the claw
  
Autonomous was the responsibility of my partner Andrew and completely written by him. The focus of the autonomous code was to score points during the 30 second period allotted for autonomous. Here we need to scan a cone that tells the robot to park in one of the three different parking spots in the arena and then move there.
